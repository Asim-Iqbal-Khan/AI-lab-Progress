    "# **Live Tic Tac Toe Game with Minimax AI**\n",
    "You will develop an interactive Tic Tac Toe game where a human plays against a computer. The computer uses the Minimax algorithm to calculate the best possible move every time it’s its turn. This means that the computer will always play optimally, ensuring that if you both play perfectly, the game will end in a draw."

    "## **Objectives**\n",
    "- **Interactive Play:**\n",
    "    Create a live game loop that allows real-time turns between a human player and the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Minimax AI Integration:**\n",
    "    Implement the Minimax algorithm so the computer always chooses the best move based on the current board state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Game State Management:**\n",
    "    Track and update the board, check for wins or draws after each move, and provide clear feedback to the player.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Interface:**\n",
    "    Build a simple interface (console-based ) that displays the game board, accepts user moves, and shows the computer's moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Detailed Task Requirements**\n",
    "1. ### **Board Setup**\n",
    "    - **Board Representation:**\n",
    "        - Use a 3×3 grid (e.g., a two-dimensional array) to represent the game board.\n",
    "        - Each cell should be able to store one of three states: empty, 'X', or 'O'.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Initialization:**\n",
    "        - Start with an empty board (all cells are empty).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ### **Game Rules and Logic**\n",
    "    - **Players:**\n",
    "        - **Human Player:** Typically plays as 'O'.\n",
    "        - **Computer Player:** Plays as 'X' and uses the Minimax algorithm to decide its moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Gameplay Flow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. **Human Turn:**\n",
    "\n",
    "            - The player selects an empty cell (using input like row and column).\n",
    "\n",
    "            - Validate that the cell is empty before accepting the move.\n",
    "\n",
    "        2. **Computer Turn:**\n",
    "\n",
    "            - After the human moves, the computer calculates its best move using the Minimax algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "            - The board is updated with the computer's move.\n",
    "\n",
    "        3. **Game End Check:**\n",
    "\n",
    "            - After each move, check if there is a win (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or if the board is full (resulting in a draw).\n",
    "\n",
    "            - If the game is over, display the result (win, loss, or draw).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ### **Implementing the Minimax Algorithm**\n",
    "    - **Terminal State Check:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Create a function that checks if the board is in a terminal state:\n",
    "\n",
    "            - A win for either player (return a score of +10 if the computer wins, -10 if the human wins).\n",
    "\n",
    "            - A draw (return 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Recursive Minimax Function:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Write a recursive function that:\n",
    "\n",
    "            - **Simulates Moves:**\n",
    "\n",
    "                - For every empty cell, simulate placing the computer’s or human’s symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "            - **Recursion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "                - Recursively evaluate the game outcome from that move.\n",
    "\n",
    "            - **Backtracking:**\n",
    "\n",
    "                - Reset the board after simulating the move.\n",
    "\n",
    "            - **Decision Making:**\n",
    "\n",
    "                - When it’s the computer’s turn (maximizing), choose the move with the highest score.\n",
    "\n",
    "                - When it’s the human’s turn (minimizing), choose the move with the lowest score.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Optimal Move Selection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Create a function that iterates through all empty cells, applies the Minimax function to each move, and selects the move with the best score for the computer.\n",
    "        \n",
    "\n",
    "4. ### **User Interface and Game Loop**\n",
    "    - **Display the Board:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Implement a function that prints or displays the board in a clear format.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **User Input:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - For a console application, prompt the user to enter the row and column for their move.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Game Loop:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Structure the game to repeat the following until the game ends:\n",
    "\n",
    "            1. Display the current board.\n",
    "\n",
    "            2. Get and validate the human player's move.\n",
    "\n",
    "            3. Update the board and check for a win or draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "            4. If the game is still ongoing, calculate and make the computer's move.\n",
    "\n",
    "            5. Update the board and check again for a terminal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **End-of-Game:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Once a win or draw is detected, display the final board and announce the result."
